Materials for demonstrating or teaching Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality to senior citizens


I am teaching a hands-on introductory class in Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality in the Bellevue College TELOS program. TELOS is a program targeted at retirees, and my students have ranged from about 55 to about 85 years old.

The three classes I have taught so far have gone very well and the students have enjoyed themselves, learned a lot, impressed their grandchildren, and made new friends.

I am sharing the class materials I have created to help other people who are developing VR programs or VR classes for independent seniors and senior living residents.
