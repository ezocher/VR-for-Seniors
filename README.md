# VR-for-Seniors

Materials for demonstrating or teaching Virtual Reality and/or Augmented Reality to senior citizens


## Origin of the Materials
I am teaching a [hands-on introductory class](https://www.campusce.net/bc/course/course.aspx?C=15333&pc=1998&mc=&sc=) in Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality in the [Bellevue College TELOS program](https://www.bellevuecollege.edu/ce/retiree-programs/). TELOS is a program targeted at retirees, and my students have ranged from about 55 to about 85 years of age.

The three classes I have taught so far have gone very well and the students have enjoyed themselves, learned a lot, impressed their grandchildren, and made new friends.

I am sharing the class materials I have created to help other people who are developing VR experiences or VR classes for independent seniors or senior living residents.

## Materials Overview
  * **Documents-for-students/Class-Handout-1** -- This is the first-day handout that I print and give to the students. It has an overview of the course, shows the headsets and apps used in class, and has a page of links and book recommendations.

#### I will be uploading more materials including lecture slides, device reference cards, and application reference cards after I have reviewed and modified them to insure they contain no copyrighted images.
#### Contact me at zocherclass![at sign](Images/at-sign.png)gmail.com if you have questions or if you need access to these materials now.
## Approach of the Class
TELOS classes are informal but have deep content (e.g. Environmental Law is taught by a former EPA lawyer), so I have tried to give students a broad overview of the current state of VR and AR and I have them experience a full sample of the current range of mainstream headsets and apps. The class also covers a little bit of technology and terminology.

Depending on your scope and objectives, you may want to ignore most of the lecture content.
## Assistants/Docents
It is important for VR beginners to be assisted and monitored while using VR. This is especially important for seniors (and young people). If you have assistants/docents for your class or program I recommend having one person assisting each VR user. [Here is a great example](https://www.siff.net/Documents/HR/2018/HR_VolunteerVRDocent_2018.pdf) of a job description for VR docents.
## Buddy System
If you don't have assistants or docents available and you're teaching a class, I recommend pairing up your students into teams of two for the duration of your class. I have used this approach in my classes and it has been very successful. The intensive student-to-student interaction required has also led to a strong sense of community/co-learning in my classes.

If you plan to try a buddy system it's necessary to clearly explain the responsibilites and importance to the students and to remind them in each class. The slides I used for this are here (TBD).



## Safety and Comfort

TBD.


## Recommendations
### For VR / AR Classes
The materials shared here are for a six hour class (4 meetings of 1 1/2 hours) where I spend 2 hours on lectures and 4 hours with the students using VR/AR. About 1/2 hour of the lecture material focuses on logistics and safety (e.g. the Buddy System) and I have pulled it out into a seperate presentation (TBD).

### For VR Exposure/Experience Programs
I have had the most success (and users have had the most enjoyment) across all age groups and technical abilities with the Oculus Go. Having a single controller is easier for beginning users and being seated for their first VR experiences is a good idea for all age groups.

If your objective is just to expose seniors to the joy and wonder of VR and/or have them engage in one or two specific experiences, then I strongly recommend focusing on the Oculus Go.
